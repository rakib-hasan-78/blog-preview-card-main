## Overview
This project is a visually appealing blog layout built using HTML and CSS. The design is responsive, modern, and focuses on presenting content in an organized and user-friendly manner. It features structured sections for the blog post, author information, and attribution, with additional use of SVG graphics for visual enhancements.

### The challenge
This project is part of a Frontend Mentor challenge, designed to help improve HTML and CSS skills by building a responsive and well-structured blog layout. The objective was to create a clean, modern blog card with key information such as a featured image, title, summary, tags, publication date, and author information. The challenge also emphasizes responsiveness, ensuring that the layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.


### Requirements
- Build a blog layout using HTML and CSS.
- Include a blog post container with a featured image, title, summary, and metadata such as tags and publication date.
- Display the author’s name and an avatar image in the blog card.
- Style the content using CSS, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Ensure the layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

### Goals

- Create a visually engaging design with modern and minimalist aesthetics.
- Implement an intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy and good use of white space.
- Ensure the blog post content is structured logically with proper HTML5 semantic elements.
- Use SVG for scalable and crisp image rendering.
- Make the layout fully responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes without breaking the design.

This project serves as a great practice for honing skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design, while also focusing on creating clean and maintainable code.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to practice and refine various web development skills, particularly in HTML and CSS. Here are some key takeaways:

### 1. **SVGs for Scalable Graphics**
   - I learned how to incorporate scalable vector graphics (SVG) into the design, which allowed me to use a crisp and scalable image for the blog card's featured image. This was a great way to keep the layout responsive while maintaining high image quality.

### 2. **Semantic HTML Structure**
   - I reinforced the importance of using semantic HTML tags, such as `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`, to improve accessibility and SEO. These elements help structure the content logically and meaningfully.

### 3. **CSS Flexbox for Layout**
   - Flexbox was crucial in building a responsive layout. I used it to easily align elements within the blog post container, ensuring they adjust to different screen sizes without breaking the design.

### 4. **Responsive Design**
   - I focused on creating a fully responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes. This included using relative units (like percentages) and media queries to make the blog card layout adapt smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### 5. **Styling with Custom CSS**
   - I enhanced my CSS skills by styling the blog post elements to make them visually appealing. This included working with fonts, colors, spacing, and borders, as well as experimenting with hover states for interactivity.

### 6. **The Importance of Visual Hierarchy**
   - I realized how essential it is to establish a clear visual hierarchy in web design. By using different font sizes, colors, and spacing, I was able to guide the user’s eye through the blog post content, making it easier to digest and more engaging.

This project has given me a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, and the importance of responsive, accessible web design. I feel more confident in building well-structured and visually appealing layouts.
